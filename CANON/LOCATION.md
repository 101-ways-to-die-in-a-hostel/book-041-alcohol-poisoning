### The Death Location (Specific)
**Where exactly does the death occur?**
The rooftop bar, specifically at the main bar counter where the drinking competitions take place. A faded chalkboard behind the bar tracks "champions." The bar is made of old boat wood and covered with years of carved graffiti and drink stains. Fairy lights string across the roof. The spot where Chad falls is between a bean bag and a wooden pillar that's been carved with hundreds of names.

## The City

**City:** Ios (Chora)
**Country:** Greece
**Population:** ~2,000 year-round (swells to 10,000+ in summer)
**Known for:** Party island reputation, beautiful beaches, young backpacker scene

### Geography
- **Climate:** Mediterranean - hot dry summers (35C+), mild winters

### Culture
- **Language(s):** Greek (English widely spoken in tourist areas)

- **Type of tourists:** Party / Beach / Young backpackers on Greece circuit
- **Danger level:** Low crime, but high party-related incident rate

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Hungover groans, ferries honking, roosters, cicadas starting up
- Afternoon: Bass from pool parties, drunk laughter, splashing, multilingual shouting
- Night: Deafening club music from village, distant screams of fun, glass breaking
- Unique sounds: The specific whooshing sound of the Aegean wind, donkeys braying

### Smells
- Hostel: Sunscreen, stale beer, chlorine, morning vomit being hosed away
- Street: Souvlaki, sea salt, bougainvillea, exhaust from motorbikes
- Specific to death location: Ouzo/anise, sweat, spilled tsipouro, someone's cheap perfume

### Textures
- Surfaces: Rough whitewash walls, sticky bar tops, wobbly plastic chairs, cool tile floors
- Climate feel: Oppressive dry heat, skin always slightly damp with sweat or sea

### Tastes
- Local food: Gyros, Greek salad, fresh seafood (when tourists bother to eat)
- Hostel offerings: Continental breakfast (stale bread, processed cheese), overpriced bar food, sponsored energy drinks

### Visual Details
- Colors: Blinding white buildings, impossibly blue sky and sea, pink bougainvillea, neon bar signs
- Light quality: Harsh Mediterranean sun, beautiful golden hour, harsh nightclub strobes
- Distinctive visuals: Windmills on the hill, cruise ships in the distance, sea of passed-out backpackers by the pool

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Yannis Papadopoulos
**Description:** 28, local who returned after Athens university. Cynical but efficient. Has seen everything. Goes through a pack of cigarettes per night shift.
**Role in death:** Oblivious - working downstairs during the incident, heard about it after

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Maria | 60s, doesn't speak to guests, crosses herself when passing "that spot" |
| Security | Kostas | Massive, ex-military, only intervenes in fights, not drinking |
| Bar/Kitchen | Emma (British) | Working for free accommodation, serves drinks all night |
| Manager | Alex Dimitriou | Owns three hostels on island, rarely present, only cares about money |

### Staff Knowledge
Staff knows the drinking games are dangerous but management forbids intervention - "guests are adults making their own choices" is the official line. Emma the bartender has tried to cut people off before and was threatened with termination. Maria the cleaner has worked here for 15 years and could tell stories that would shut the place down.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Recovery zone. Zombie-like guests in sunglasses nursing hangovers by the pool. Quiet desperation. Occasional vomiting sounds from bathrooms. The energetic arrive at noon asking "what time does the party start?"

### Night Vibe
Chaos incarnate. Pre-gaming starts at 6 PM. Competitive energy. Loud music. Hookup tension. By 11 PM, it's a full-scale party with guests from other hostels showing up. The rooftop becomes a sweaty, pulsing mass of young bodies.

### Guest Demographics
Primarily 18-25, Americans, Australians, British, and Dutch. Some Scandinavians. Few older travelers, who leave after one night. "Gap year" backpackers, recent graduates, and young professionals "finding themselves."

### Reputation
Online reviews are polarized: either "BEST PARTY EVER 5 STARS" or "Dirty, loud, couldn't sleep, 1 star." Word of mouth in backpacker circles is that this is THE place for drinking competitions. A Reddit thread about "craziest party hostels" mentions it in every response.

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Ferry from Athens (Piraeus) - 7 hours, or from Santorini/Mykonos - 1-2 hours. Hostel offers free pickup from the port with a tuk-tuk covered in their branding.

### Check-in Process
Chaotic. Sign the liability waiver (nobody reads it), hand over passport (they forget to return them regularly), get a wristband that's also your bar tab. "Pre-game shot" offered at check-in.

### Rules
1. No glass by the pool
2. Quiet hours 4AM-10AM (not enforced)
3. No outside alcohol in common areas
4. "What happens at Olympus stays at Olympus"
(Written on a sign: "The hostel is not responsible for lost items, lost dignity, or bad decisions")

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: terrible during peak hours)
- [x] Kitchen (usually unusable)
- [x] Lockers (extra fee, often broken)
- [x] Laundry (coin-operated, basement)
- [x] Pool (small, green by Wednesday)
- [x] Bar (main attraction)
- [x] Rooftop (legendary sunset views)
- [x] Tours offered (hangover boat trips)
- [x] Other: Drinking games, beer pong tournament, flip cup championships

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Ios's party reputation is real but has been somewhat cleaned up in recent years
- Greek island emergency services are limited
- The ferry connections and geography should be accurate
- Local Greek attitudes toward tourist excess should be nuanced

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Don't portray all Greeks as enabling party culture - show locals who disapprove
- Acknowledge that the party scene is largely created by and for tourists
- Greeks are moderate drinkers; the binge culture is imported

- Hostelworld reviews of Greek party hostels
- Travel forums about Ios nightlife
