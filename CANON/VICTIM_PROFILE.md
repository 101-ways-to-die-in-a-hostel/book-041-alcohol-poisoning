# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

## Archetype
**Primary:** Frat Bro / Party Animal

**Secondary traits:**
- Deeply insecure beneath the bravado
- Obsessed with "winning" at everything
- Secretly terrified of his father's disappointment

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Pride

**How it manifests:**
- Cannot back down from any challenge, ever
- Interprets walking away as permanent character failure
- Measures self-worth entirely through victories and conquests

**How it kills them:**
Chad's inability to admit defeat or weakness means he keeps drinking long after his body screams to stop, viewing his own survival instincts as obstacles to overcome rather than warnings to heed.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 6'2", broad-shouldered, former varsity lacrosse player going slightly soft
- **Hair:** Sandy blonde, perpetually styled with too much product
- **Distinguishing features:** Tribal tattoo on right bicep (got it freshman year), Rolex knockoff from Thailand
- **Typical outfit:** Tank top showing off arms, cargo shorts, backwards baseball cap, boat shoes without socks

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Competitive spirit - becomes inability to recognize when to quit
2. Loyalty to friends - becomes susceptibility to peer pressure

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Machismo - leads to dismissing all danger signs as weakness
2. Performative confidence - leads to escalating reckless behavior to maintain image

### Pet Peeves
- People who "can't hang" (deeply ironic given death)
- Being told what to do by anyone
- Guys who drink "girly drinks"

### Fears
- Surface fear: Being seen as weak or "soft"
- Deeper fear: Being exactly like his emotionally absent, alcoholic father

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in upper-middle-class Columbus suburb. Father is a successful but cold corporate lawyer who expressed love through money and criticism. Mother enabled Chad's behavior, seeing his "spirit" as admirable. Peaked socially in college, where Greek life validated his entire personality. Graduated with a 2.4 GPA and no job prospects.

### Why They Travel
Parents gave him a "gap year trip" as a graduation present (really: to get him out of the house while they figure out what to do with him). He frames it as "conquering the world" but it's really avoiding adult responsibilities and the terrifying question of who he is without a team or fraternity.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Heard about the infamous "Olympus Hostel" in Ios, Greece, known for its drinking competitions and party reputation. Came specifically to dominate and add legendary stories to his repertoire. Plans to spend two weeks here before moving on.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "Bro," "crush it," "legend," "weak sauce," "let's gooo," "no cap"
- Avoids words like: Any emotional vocabulary, vulnerability, "help"
- Catchphrases: "What are you, scared?" / "Sleep when you're dead" / "All gas no brakes"

### Speech Pattern
- Short, aggressive sentences
- Speaks loudly, takes up space
- Constant competitive framing of everything
- Valley inflection on challenges (statements that sound like questions)

### Internal Monologue Style
His thoughts are a constant sports commentary, keeping score, evaluating threat levels of other males, calculating social hierarchies. Underneath: desperate need for validation, terror of inadequacy.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram and Snapchat
- **Follower count:** 2,847 (mostly from college)
- **Posting style:** Shirtless photos, drinking content, "living my best life" captions
- **Last post before death:** Video chugging ouzo with caption "These Greek boys can't keep up" followed by flexing emoji

### Online vs Reality
Posts show an endless party of confidence and conquest. Reality: most nights he drinks alone until he blacks out, wakes up anxious, then does it again. He hasn't texted his parents in three weeks.

## Relationships

### Family
- Father (Richard): Distant, disappointed, but paying for everything
- Mother (Karen): Enabling, sends him money when he asks, doesn't ask questions
- Younger sister (Madison): Actually worried about him, texts go unanswered

### Friends
- Had fraternity brothers but no deep friendships
- "Friends" on the road are drinking buddies who disappear when the party ends

### Romantic
- Recent breakup that he refuses to discuss. She said he "wasn't emotionally available." He told everyone she was "crazy."

### At the Hostel
- Immediately establishes dominance with other young males
- Views local Greek guys as competition
- Dismissive of anyone who won't drink with him
- Briefly connects with Australian guy Karl who will be his drinking partner/enabler

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Hungover but refuses to admit it. Chugs "hair of the dog" beer at breakfast while others cringe. Loudly announces his plan to set the hostel's drinking game record tonight.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Standing at the hostel bar at sunset, genuinely happy, surrounded by cheering people, feeling like he finally belongs somewhere. For a moment, he considers calling it a night. Then someone challenges him to another round.

### Final Thoughts
*This isn't right. Something's really wrong. I can't feel my arms. I need to tell them to stop. But I can't... they're all watching. Just one more and then I'll quit. I just need to prove... prove... what was I proving? Mom? I don't feel good. I want to go home.*

### Last Words
"I'm good, I'm good, I'm... I can't..." (collapses)

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Other men (are they threats or allies?), attractive women, who's watching him
- They ignore: His own body's distress signals, genuine concern from others, warning signs everywhere
- They judge: Everyone by their "toughness" and party stamina

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [ ] Introduction scene establishing archetype (arriving at hostel, immediately challenges someone)
- [ ] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) - refuses to stop at first warning sign
- [ ] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) - phone call with worried sister he can't quite answer
- [ ] Warning ignored scene - vomits, keeps going
- [ ] Point of no return - the seventeenth shot
- [ ] The death
